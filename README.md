# flair-vulnerability-scanner
Repository used to scan Flair images for vurnabilities

## Startup

In order to scan a Flair docker iamge, you need to start a scanner first, then start the scan.

### Start the scanner

First start the database, clair (scanner) and a docker registry by running

```bash
./start.sh
```

Wait for at least 30 minutes after startup to wait for the clair to pull vulnerability 
into a local postgresql database, otherwise you won't find any vulnerabilities.

### Do the scan

Then, run the scanning by first editing the following file `scan/klarrunner/.env`

```
APPNAME=flair-engine
APPVER=latest
```

where `APPNAME` is a flair docker image name, and `APPVER` is the version you would like to 
scan (latest by default).

After that run

```bash
./scan.sh
```

You should see high and critical vulnerability scanning results on the screen.

The `scan.sh` file builds the `klar` docker image from the `scan/klarrunner` folder
that starts the actual scan. Then it pulls the image you requested to scan into 
the local docker repository, and then starts the scanning.

## Troubleshooting

If any issues, run the following commands and try again.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/scanner-docker-compose.yml down
```

```bash
docker-compose -f scan/klarrunner-docker-compose.yml down
```
